<h1>Steven Dorsher</h1>
<h2>Former Computational Physicist</h2>
<p>I have had a 15+ year research career in physics and astronomy over the course of my bachelors degree, three masters degrees, and since my final graduation. Most of this (10+ years) has been in computational physics. My primary focus is in general relativity, black holes, and gravitational waves. I have also done research in cosmology, particle physics, neutrinos, exoplanets, the three body Newtonian gravity problem, and fractional calculus.</p>


<p>I have 8 main publications/documents and about 35 total including membership in LIGO spanning the time of the first three detections.</p> 


<p>My background is primarily in scientific programming, in the context of data analysis algorithms, experiment development and assessment, and numerical methods for theory.</p>
